  old versions of Python, NumPy, and SciPy.

Abstract
========

This SPEC recommends that all projects across the Scientific Python
ecosystem adopt a common "time window-based" policy for support of
Python, NumPy, and SciPy versions.
Standardizing a recommendation for project support of minimum Python,
NumPy, and SciPy versions will improve downstream project planning.

Detailed description
====================

This SPEC is based off of [NEP 29[](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).

For the purposes of this SPEC we assume semantic versioning and define:

*major version*
   A release that changes the first number (e.g. X.0.0)

*minor version*
   A release that changes the second number (e.g 1.Y.0)

*patch version*
   A release that changes the third number (e.g. 1.1.Z)


Python has a minor release annually (see  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/).
NumPy and SciPy both make minor releases around twice a year.

When a project releases a new major or minor version, we recommend that
they support at least all minor versions of Python introduced and
released in the prior 42 months *from the anticipated release date* with
a minimum of 2 minor versions of Python, and all minor versions of NumPy
released in the prior 24 months *from the anticipated release date* with
a minimum of 3 minor versions of NumPy.

    On Jan 13, 2021 drop support for NumPy 1.16 (initially released on Jan 13, 2019)
    On Jul 26, 2021 drop support for NumPy 1.17 (initially released on Jul 26, 2019)
    On Dec 22, 2021 drop support for NumPy 1.18 (initially released on Dec 22, 2019)
    On Dec 26, 2021 drop support for Python 3.7 (initially released on Jun 27, 2018)
    On Jun 21, 2022 drop support for NumPy 1.19 (initially released on Jun 20, 2020)
    On Apr 14, 2023 drop support for Python 3.8 (initially released on Oct 14, 2019)

Implementation
==============

We suggest that all projects adopt the following language into their
development guidelines:

> This project supports:
>
> -   All minor versions of Python released 42 months prior to the
>     project, and at minimum the two latest minor versions.
> -   All minor versions of `numpy` released in the 24 months prior to
>     the project, and at minimum the last three minor versions.
> -   All minor versions of `scipy` released in the 24 months prior to
>     the project, and at minimum the last three minor versions.
>
> In `setup.py`, the `python_requires` variable should be set to the
> minimum supported version of Python. All supported minor versions of
> Python should be in the test matrix and have binary artifacts built
> for the release.
>
> Minimum Python and NumPy version support should be adjusted upward on
> every major and minor release, but never on a patch release.

**FIXME** Projects could register and we could have a system file an issue
on GitHub when it is time to drop a version.  And we should list the projects
who agree to the SPEC here.

Backward compatibility
======================

No backward compatibility issues.
