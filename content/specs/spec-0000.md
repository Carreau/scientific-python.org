What is a SPEC?
===============

The SPEC author is responsible for building consensus within the
community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the SPECs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal[^1].

Format and Template
===================

SPECs are UTF-8 encoded text files using 

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format.

Please see the `spec-template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} file and
for more information.

We use [Hugo](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to convert SPECs to HTML
for viewing on the web [^2].


Header Preamble

Each NXEP must begin with a header preamble. The headers must appear in
the following order. Headers marked with `*` are optional. All other
headers are required. :
